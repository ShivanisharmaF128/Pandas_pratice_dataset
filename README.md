# Pandas_pratice_dataset

This repository contains my practice projects exploring different datasets using Python’s Pandas library. Each notebook focuses on data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization without applying any machine learning models — just pure Pandas functionality.

---

## Technologies & Tools:
- **Python**(Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)

- **Jupyter Notebooks**

- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

---

## Purpose:

This repository showcases my ability to work with real-world data using only Pandas. It demonstrates data wrangling, 
feature exploration, and insight generation — a foundation for further machine learning work.
